# Insurance_Predictive_Model
Creation of a multi-variate regression model to predict medical charges incurred by the insuree.

It's critical for an insurance company to be able to assess risk when onboarding a new insuree. Granted life is unpredictable, here I sought to create a regression model to try and predict the cost of bringing on a new insuree.

To do so, I utlized the following features: age, sex, bmi, # of children, smoker, and region of the U.S. where insuree is from.

**** NOTE **** 

Granted this dataset is modest in size and supplied by Kaggle, here I demonstrate competency in data exploration, organizing and preparation for machine learning analysis.
